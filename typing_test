#Animal Farm
passage_1 = """Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. 
No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures 
outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; 
but already it was impossible to say which was which."""

#1984
passage_2 = """For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or 
that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the 
past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is 
controllable – what then?"""

# Pride and Prejudice
passage_3 = """Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often
used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more 
to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."""

# The Great Gatsby
passage_4 = """I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had 
done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. 
They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures 
and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever 
it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had 
made."""

#Fahrenheit 451
passage_5 = """We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As 
in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run 
over; so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart 
run over."""

# To Kill a Mockingbird
passage_6 = """Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. 
They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they don’t do one 
thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a 
mockingbird."""

# The Picture of Dorian Gray
passage_7 = """Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt 
without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in 
beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect 
to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or 
an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all."""

# The Catcher in the Rye
passage_8 = """What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done 
reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and 
you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't 
happen much, though."""

# Brave New World
passage_9 = """Did you ever feel, as though you had something inside you that 
was only waiting for you to give it a chance to come out? Some sort of extra 
power that you aren't using - you know, like all the water that goes down the 
falls instead of through the turbines?""" 

# Frankenstein
passage_10 = """Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, 
how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is 
who believes his native town to be his world, than he who aspires to become 
greater than his nature will allow."""
